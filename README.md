Contacto — Powercoders Bootcamp API Exercise

A minimal front‑end that fetches and displays a random contact card using the public Random User API. Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

├── index.html   # markup and layout
├── style.css    # styles (colors, spacing, responsive tweaks)
└── app.js       # fetch logic + DOM rendering

🧠 How it Works
	•	getdata() calls fetch("https://randomuser.me/api/")
	•	On success, it extracts the first results[0] item
	•	It builds the contact card (name, picture, email, phone) and injects into #personinfo
	•	Errors are logged to the console for debugging

🛠️ Customization
	•	Adjust colors and spacing in style.css
	•	Add more fields (location, DOB, etc.) by reading additional properties from the API response
	•	Replace the data source with another public API if needed

🔒 Data Authenticity & Privacy

This project displays fake person data generated by the Random User Generator for training and demonstration. It does not contain real personal data.
	•	Random User API: https://randomuser.me/

✅ Accessibility & Compatibility
	•	Uses semantic HTML and sufficient color contrast
	•	Works in modern evergreen browsers (Chromium, Firefox, Safari)
